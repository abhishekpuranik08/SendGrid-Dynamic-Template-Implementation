this is about how you can integrate SendGrid's Dynamic Templates into a Java 17 Spring application using the SendGrid library version 4.10.1. This will allow you to send emails using dynamic templates configured in your SendGrid account.


Add SendGrid Dependency: Start by including the SendGrid dependency in your pom.xml.
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.sendgrid</groupId>
    <artifactId>sendgrid-java</artifactId>
    <version>4.10.1</version>
</dependency>

its good Practise to use the latest version.
SendGrid Configuration: Store your SendGrid API key securely, either in application properties or environment variables in my case i stored it in database.

Service Class for Email Integration:

Set up the SendGrid client.
Create a service to send emails using a dynamic template.
